# Matching Brackets

Given a string containing brackets `[]`, braces `{}`, parentheses `()`,
or any combination thereof, verify that any and all pairs are matched
and nested correctly.

## Making the Test Suite Pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ crystal spec
```

In each test suite all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by changing `pending` to `it`.
